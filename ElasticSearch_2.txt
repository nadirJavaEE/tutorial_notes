Pluralsight - Searching and Analyzing Data with Elasticsearch: Getting Started
by Janani Ravi

Partie 01 : Introduction 

    - Apache Lucene : indexing and search library for a performance, full text search engine
    - elasticsearch : built on apache Lucene
      * distributed : scales to thousands of nodes 
      * high availability 
      * restful api
      * powerful query DSL 
      * Schemaless
       
     - Working with elasticsearch 
      * As a service in the cloud (kibana and elasticsearch - 14 days free)  
      * in your local machine
      
     - Specify the name of the cluster and node at startup 
      * elasticsearch -Ecluster.name=nadir_es -Enode.name=my_first_node
       
     - Basic concepts of elasticsearch 
      * cluster = multiple nodes 
      * index = collection of similar documents 
       
     - localhost:9200 --> the health of the cluster
     - http://localhost:9200/_cat/health?v&pretty : 
     - http://localhost:9200/_cat/nodes?v&pretty
     
Partie 02 : CRUD operations 

     - curl : a tool that allows you to transfer data from and to a server using a variety of protocols 
     
     - curl -XGET "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v&pretty"
       get all the indices present in the cluster
       
     - create index : 
       * curl -XPUT "localhost:9200/indexName?&pretty" 
        
     - add a document to an index : 
       * curl -XPUT "localhost:9200/products/mobiles/1?pretty" -d 
         "name" : "iphone7",
         "camera" : "12MP",
         "storage" : "256GB",
         "display":"4.7inch",
         "battery" : "1,96mAh",
         "reviews" : ["Incredibly happy after having used it for one week", "Best iPhone so far", "Very expensive" ]
